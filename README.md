# Lesson 3

Ok great! Now we can start doing some exciting stuff.

## Tasks

1. Create a totalSupply field and add the total supply you want to provide to this token

2. Create a decimals field to indicate how many decimals this token will have

3. Create a balanceOf field which is a map of all the users and their balances

4. Add a contructor to the Token contract and give the initial total supply to the user who deployed the contract

5. Create unit tests to
  - check that totalSupply is correct
  - check decimals field is correct
  - check the balanceOf of the deploy is correct
