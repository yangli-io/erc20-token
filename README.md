# Lesson 1

This is the first and it's all about setting up your workspace

First, clone this barebone repository

After your git clone has finished, install your node.js dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

The project currently has a very simple setup with a simple web app in the dapp folder which we will explore later.

## Tasks

1. First download the Truffle CLI

```bash
yarn global add truffle
```

2. Initialize with truffle

```bash
truffle init
```
